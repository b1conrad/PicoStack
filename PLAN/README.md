# Pico Labs Affiliate Network (PLAN)

See [the PLAN repo](https://github.com/Picolab/PLAN).
See also [the PLAN itself](https://plan.picolabs.io/).

Many of the rulesets in the `languages/krl` folder herein were written for the By Name network.
That network is being retired, but I'm leaving the rulesets there for historical reasons,
and because some of them are linked to from [the PicoStack blog](https://picostack.org/).

This folder will contain adaptations of those rulesets,
keeping the ruleset identifier (RID) but having code consistent with the PLAN.

## The module `html.plan`

This ruleset is hosted here: [https://github.com/Picolab/PLAN/blob/main/krl/html.plan.krl](https://github.com/Picolab/PLAN/blob/main/krl/html.plan.krl)

Any app that is compatible with a PLAN pico will need to use that ruleset as a module
(typically aliased as `html`).
